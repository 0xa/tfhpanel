Tux-FreeHost Panel
==================

Documentation
-------------
There is no *complete* documentation yet. However,
you can [follow](https://twitter.com/tuxfreehost) the project on twitter,
read [the blog](http://tux-fh.net/posts.html), post in
[the forum](http://forum.tux-fh.net), or come chat with us on #TuxFH @ Freenode.

Installation and Management
---------------------------
You can use the installation/management [scripts](https://gist.github.com/Edelwin/7857978) which uses python3, or the
[python2 one](https://gist.github.com/NyanKiyoshi/9028494)

If you just want to launch the panel, you (really) should activate the virtual environment and type : 
```bash
bin/pserve development.ini
```
(it implies that you have satisfied all the dependencies)

Project status
--------------
The developers is sorely lacking. So if you want to help, there is a todo list [here](https://etherpad.fr/p/tfhtodo).
